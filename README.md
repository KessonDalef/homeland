A WebGL2 experiment with custom GLSL, using a bunch of *ify npm modules (glslify, browserify, uglify, monetify - unfortunately the latter doesn't exist).

### how to run on your own machine, modify and expand
If you really find it interesting, download it, run it, modifify it, destroy it (please!).

###### Download it

`git clone https://github.com/KessonDalef/homeland.git`

###### Run it
Use a simple web server. I personally find very interesting the live server on Visual Studio Code, but if you know any better solution go for it (and tell me please!)

###### Modify it
Once you start messing around with the code and you don't know how to compile it, you will need nodejs > 8.11 and a bunch of packages. Once you downloaded and installed nodejs on your machine, enter the folder with the terminal and do a simple

`npm install`

###### Build it
As it uses gulp, you will only need to run 

`gulp build`

everytime you make an edit.

### Thanks to

The tutorial by Matthew Willox was very helpful to understand how to handle glslify, I just adapted it for Three.js. There are not so many tutorials out there for this, I might write one.

Find the tutorial here: http://blog.gskinner.com/archives/2019/01/custom-shader-glslify.html

### License
Do everything you want with the code, as long as it is not for commercial purpose (jn that case let me know). Just, mentioning me would be much appreciated. 

Sharing is caring.
